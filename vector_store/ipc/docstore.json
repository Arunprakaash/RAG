A and B administer the \npoison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to \nhim. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is \ncaused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. \n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, \nintending to cause Z's death, knowingly co-operate in causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his \nattendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of \nZ. \n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z's death, illegally omits to supply Z with food; in \nconsequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from \nhis office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that \nhe is likely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty \nonly of an attempt to commit murder. \n38.

Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.\u2014\nNothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake \nof fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in \ndoing it. \nIllustration \nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder.

Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the \nboat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, \nthough he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of \nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \nimminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence. \n82.

Here, though B was not capable \nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's \ninstigation.

B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in \nconsequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B \nto commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \nExplanation 5.\u2014It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \nIllustration \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C \nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \nprocures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in \nconsequence.

Culpable homicide.\u2014Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing \ndeath, or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the \nknowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. \nIllustrations \n(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to \nbe thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \nhomicide. \n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, \ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \nhomicide. \n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. \nHere, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause \ndeath by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. \nExplanation 1.\u2014A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, \ndisease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused \nhis death. \nExplanation 2.\u2014Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury \nshall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment \nthe death might have been prevented. \nExplanation 3.\u2014The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may \namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought \nforth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. \n300. Murder.\u2014Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or\u2014 \n2ndly.\u2014If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be \nlikely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or\u2014 \n3rdly.\u2014If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury \nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or\u2014 \n4thly.\u2014If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all \nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without \nany excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. \nIllustrations \n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of \nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death. \n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, \nalthough he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4360, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c10ba7fb-b498-493a-8f76-f68e6db2df19": {"__data__": {"id_": "c10ba7fb-b498-493a-8f76-f68e6db2df19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1637e456-a963-48fd-be65-63e020d48fed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66349f4ba01be0824e08a37f900aa1a30541c21310bfc5afa5e20a620cae8dcc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e64fbdd-5eb7-4430-86e7-bf7444dc5a0b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "72f71e08131052825ab607d9d4a1d6cbbbcacfedaa66cc24610bd7c3fb5fe64a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bab0ee6-cf2e-4ea7-a27f-67dc76d97643", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd05d075c6b0250831ed0b2c1c68beeec5cad5489519ac0b478664adb59c0f59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "5ef76b2d45ba7858dcaf291f6bad74c619ac770c21a483aebaf9176689592838", "text": "70 \n \nException 1.\u2014When culpable homicide is not murder.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the \noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:\u2014 \nFirst.\u2014That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for \nkilling or doing harm to any person. \nSecondly.\u2014That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \nThirdly.\u2014That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of \nprivate defence. \nExplanation.\u2014Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \namounting to murder is a question of fact. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child.

Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \nhomicide. \n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \n(e)A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. \nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \na thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and \nto cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only \nculpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \nException 2.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the \nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and \nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \nIllustration \nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the \nassault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has \nnot committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \nException 3.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a \npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due \ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is \ncaused. \nException 4.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue \nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \nExplanation.\u2014It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \nassault. \nException 5.\u2014Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4259, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bab0ee6-cf2e-4ea7-a27f-67dc76d97643": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bab0ee6-cf2e-4ea7-a27f-67dc76d97643", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "efa87a6d-83d2-419c-909b-aa97f32ff16d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "176c60655347ef5a40be76321c3dd4223dd52bdc956f8126c8b94975caad5fae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c10ba7fb-b498-493a-8f76-f68e6db2df19", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ef76b2d45ba7858dcaf291f6bad74c619ac770c21a483aebaf9176689592838", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "47b870b4-c4c8-4173-981c-9582a9dfaace", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e92b8636aa709df232b1a5c6b0244a043569dca8ee3c43c88d5ad48e4ecd313", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "dd05d075c6b0250831ed0b2c1c68beeec5cad5489519ac0b478664adb59c0f59", "text": "71 \n \nIllustration \nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide.

Theft.\u2014Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of \nany person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit \ntheft. \nExplanation 1.\u2014A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \nExplanation 2.\u2014A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. \nExplanation 3.\u2014A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented \nit from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \nExplanation 4.\u2014A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \nExplanation 5.\u2014The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be \ngiven either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express \nor implied. \nIllustrations \n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's \nconsent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the \ndog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may \ndishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \n(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's \nconsent. A has committed theft. \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a \ngoldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has \nnot committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A \ndishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he \nmay commit criminal misappropriation of property. \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the \n                                                           \n1.

A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, \nand carries it away.

Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express \nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it \nis probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed \ntheft. \n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. \nHere, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \n379.

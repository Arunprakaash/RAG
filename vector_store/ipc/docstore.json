Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in\n\n40  incurring the risk of running down the boat C.\n\n\tA, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading.

years in order that such child may be employed or used for the purposes of begging shall be punishable with imprisonment which shall not be less than twenty years, but which may extend to life which shall mean\n\n35  imprisonment for the remainder of that person\u2019s natural life, and with fine.\n\n\tWhere any person, not being the lawful guardian of a child below the age of eighteen years employs or uses such child for the purposes of begging, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that he kidnapped or otherwise obtained the custody of such child in order that such child might be employed or used for the purposes of begging.\n\n\t40\t(4) In this section \u201cbegging\u201d means\u2014\n\n\tsoliciting or receiving alms in a public place, whether under the pretence of

PROPERTY\t15 \n\n\t(1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of any person without that person\u2019s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit theft.\n\n\tExplanation 1.\u2014A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as\t20 \n\nsoon as it is severed from the earth.\n\nExplanation 2.\u2014A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft.\n\n\tExplanation 3.\u2014A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by\t25 \n\nactually moving it.\n\nExplanation 4.\u2014A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal.\n\n\tExplanation 5.\u2014The consent mentioned in this sectionmay be express or implied, and\t30 \n\nmay be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied.\n\n\n\nIllustrations.\n\n\tA cuts down a tree on Z\u2019s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree\n\nout of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order  35 \n\nto such taking, he has committed theft.\n\n\tA puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\u2019s dog to follow it. Here, if A\u2019s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\u2019s dog has begun to follow A.\n\n\tA meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain  40\n\ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n\n\tA being Z\u2019s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\u2019s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\u2019s consent. A has committed theft.\n\n\tZ, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall 45\n\nreturn. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it.

Here the ring is in Z\u2019s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n\n\tA finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n\n\t5\t\t(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\u2019s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.\n\n\t10\t\t(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\u2019s hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n\n\t15\t\t(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z\u2019s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n\n\tAgain, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\u2019s possession without\n\n20 Z\u2019s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n\n\tA takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\u2019s possession without Z\u2019s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft.\n\n\t25\t\t(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\u2019s library in Z\u2019s absence, and takes away a book without Z\u2019s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z\u2019s implied consent to use Z\u2019s book. If this was A\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft.\n\n\tA asks charity from Z\u2019s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows\n\n30 to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z\u2019s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A\u2019s impression, A has not committed theft.\n\n\tA is the paramour of Z\u2019s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n\n\t35\t\t(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\u2019s own property, takes that property out of Z\u2019s possession.

One of the important recommendations made by the Commission was on, Indian Penal Code which was enacted in 1860 and the said Code is still continuing in the country with some amendments made thereto from time to time.\n\n\tThe Government of India considered it expedient and necessary to review the existing criminal laws with an aim to strengthen law and order and also focus on simplifying legal procedure so that ease of living is ensured to the common man. The Government also considered to make existing laws relevant to the contemporary situation and provide speedy justice to common man. Accordingly, various stakeholders were consulted keeping in mind contemporary needs and aspirations of the people and with a view to create a legal structure which is citizen centric and to secure life and liberty of the citizens.\n\n\tNow, it is proposed to enact a new law, namely, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill, 2023 by repealing the Indian Penal Code to streamline provisions relating to offences and penalties. It is proposed to provide first time community service as one of the punishments for petty offences. The offences against women and children, murder and offences against the State have been given precedence. The various offences have been made gender neutral. In order to deal effectively with the problem of organised crimes and terrorist activities, new offences of terrorist acts and organised crime have been added in the Bill with deterrent punishments. A new offence on acts of secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities, separatist activities or endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India has also been added. The fines and punishment for various offences have also been suitably enhanced.\n\n\tThe Notes on Clauses explains the various provisions of the Bill.\n\n\tThe Bill seeks to achieve the above objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tNEW DELHI;\tAMIT SHAH.\n\nThe 9th August, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n103", "start_char_idx": 401418, "end_char_idx":
